Heptabase cares about the future-proofing of your notes. If you want to export all your data for use in other software, follow the instructions below:

1. Open Heptabase and click the settings button in the top-left corner of the sidebar.
2. Click the "Backup" option, then click the "Export now" button.

This exports all your cards, journals, highlights, mindmaps, and whiteboards as markdown files. It also includes all your PDFs, images, videos, audio, and file attachments. Tags and properties are preserved as YAML in the markdown files.
