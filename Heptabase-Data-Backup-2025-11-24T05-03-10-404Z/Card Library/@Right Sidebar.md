# @Right Sidebar

When you open a Heptabase tab, you can open the right sidebar from the top right corner of this tab, which will have all the tools that this tab can use. Here is an introduction to each tool:

- **References:** When you open a tab, you can open multiple cards or webpages on the right side to cross-reference with the main content of the tab. For example, when you're writing an article, you can open the knowledge cards that the article will refer to on the right side.

- **Insight:** When you open a note card, if it contains a large amount of text (e.g., long articles, book excerpts, transcripts), you can use the AI Insight feature to quickly grasp all the key insights from the content. This feature breaks the original text into chunks of approximately 300 words and summarizes each chunk with one key insight. Each insight can be traced back to its original content blocks, and you can also drag these insights onto a whiteboard for further sense-making. This feature is currently in an early beta phase, with limited usage quotas each month.

- **Table of Content:** When you open a card or whiteboard tab, you can see the outline of this tab. For cards, this displays the hierarchical relationship of different titles; for whiteboards, this displays the hierarchical relationship of different sections.
