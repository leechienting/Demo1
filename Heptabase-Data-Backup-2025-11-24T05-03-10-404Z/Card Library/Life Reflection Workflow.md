# Life Reflection Workflow

## Overview

1. When you have fleeting ideas that are hard to categorize, write them down in today's journal to reduce the friction of capturing ideas.

2. If you often capture important ideas in your journal, make sure to allocate time once in a while to extract these ideas onto the whiteboard for deeper thinking. You can click the journal button on the top right of the whiteboard to open it, use the selection box to select the content of your journal, and drag them to the whiteboard to turn them into a note card. You can also drag this content to an existing card on the whiteboard.

3. You can also simply use the journal to record your life and emotions without turning these contents into note cards. Instead, you can put all journal cards of the same month on the same whiteboard for a comprehensive review and reflection on this month.

4. The journal app can also serve as a lightweight to-do management system for your life. You can add to-dos on different dates and assign incomplete to-dos to another date with one click.
