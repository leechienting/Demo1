# Card

## Concept and Use Case

- A **card** is your note, as well as a container for knowledge and ideas. All cards are stored in the **Card Library** App. In addition to native Note Cards, Journal Cards, and Highlight Cards, Heptabase also supports importing specific file types into the card library, including: PDF Cards, Video Cards, Audio Cards, Image Cards, and so on.

## Basic Operations

- You can type `/` in the card editor to add any types of blocks you want: headings, lists, to-dos, toggles, tables, images, audio, videos, files, PDFs, code snippets, math equations, and dates.

- You can type `@` in the card editor to **mention other cards**, and you can see all the block-level backlinks in the info section of the card. These interconnected cards together form a knowledge network that belongs to you.
