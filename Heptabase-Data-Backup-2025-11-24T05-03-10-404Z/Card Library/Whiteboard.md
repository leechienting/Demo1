# Whiteboard

## Concept and Use Case

- A **whiteboard** is your space for thinking. Consider it as an unlimited desktop for placing cards to help you learn and research the topics you care about. All whiteboards are stored in the **Map** app. You can right-click on the map to create whiteboards for researching different topics. Additionally, you can right-click on the whiteboard to create sub-whiteboards for researching sub-topics under the main topic.

- **Whiteboards do not own cards**. All cards belong to the Card Library. When you are researching a topic on the whiteboard, you can import related cards from the Card Library and place them on the whiteboard. You can also create new cards on the whiteboard, and these cards will be directly stored in the Card Library.

- The same card can be placed on multiple whiteboards at the same time. This is similar to how our brain works - the same concept or knowledge can appear under different topics. You can see in the card's Info section which whiteboards the card appears on. If you click on a whiteboard name, it will automatically open the whiteboard and focus on the location of the card, allowing you to easily recall the thinking context of the card.

## Basic Operations

- You can right-click in the blank space of the whiteboard to create different types of objects to help you think. These include: creating cards to record ideas and knowledge; creating text to capture fleeting thoughts; creating mind maps to quickly brainstorm and clarify your thinking; creating journals to plan for the next week; creating sections to group whiteboard objects; and creating sub-whiteboards to organize knowledge of sub-topics.

- You can right-click on whiteboard objects to select the advanced operations you want to perform on them. These include changing color, activating mindmap mode, exporting files, viewing edit history, adding tags, moving to other whiteboards, opening as new tabs, etc.

- If you want to change the position and color of multiple whiteboard objects at once, or perform advanced batch operations on them, you can click the blank space of the whiteboard and drag a selection box to select multiple objects all at once.
