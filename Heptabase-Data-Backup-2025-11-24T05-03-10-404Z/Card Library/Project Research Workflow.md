# Project Research Workflow

## Overview

1. Use the hierarchical structure of the nested whiteboards to manage different topics under your research project. Create research-oriented whiteboards to store data, literature, and ideas, and create learning-oriented whiteboards to store knowledge on certain topics.

2. When you notice that certain knowledge you've learned could be useful for your project, you can import and reuse the card from your learning-oriented whiteboard to the research-oriented whiteboard to guide the project direction.

3. Visual note-taking is not the goal itself, but a process to achieve your goal. It’s okay to have messy whiteboards at the beginning. As your cards start to accumulate on your whiteboards, allocate some afternoons to organize them into a structure that can best help you achieve your research goal. You'll find this process extremely beneficial for your research.
