## Concept and Use Case

> If you're a beginner, you don't have to use tags. If you want to know when you should use tags instead of whiteboards, check out [this tutorial video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kwIfzIJ0o0).

- **Tags** are a classification system that groups similar cards and assigns properties to them. For example, let's say you have a meeting every week. You can create a tag **\#meetings** and add it to all the cards containing meeting notes. Additionally, you can add properties such as "date" and "conclusion" for all cards under the #meetings tag.

- When should I use tags and when should I use whiteboards to organize cards?

   The answer is simple: tags can be used to describe an **is-a-relationship** (e.g., Card A is a #meeting, Card B is a #blog-article, Card C is a #user-research, Card D is a #scientist), while whiteboards are used to describe topics (e.g., Whiteboard X is "History of Science," Whiteboard Y is "Company Growth Strategy," Whiteboard Z is "Nuclear Engineering Research").

   When you want to organize a set of highly homogeneous cards, you can start by using tags. When you want to learn a topic deeply, you can create a whiteboard and then drag the cards related to that topic onto the whiteboard to connect and think.

   For example, you can create tags such as #scientists (Newton, Einstein), #physics-theories (thermodynamics, relativity, quantum mechanics), #science-events (Solvay Conference, first solar eclipse observation), and visualize the relationships between the cards with these tags on the whiteboard of "history of science," helping you better understand and remember the topics you are learning and researching.

## Basic Operations

- All tags are stored in the Tag App. You can access the Tag App from the left sidebar to view all your tags. Click on the "New Tag" button to add a new tag. When adding a new tag, you can choose either the table or kanban view as the default view for cards under that tag.

- In addition to adding new tags, you can also click the "New Group" button to create groups for organizing your tags. For example, you can put the tags #meetings and #work-reports into the "Work" group, and the tags #blog-articles and #tax-returns into the "Life" group.

- If you want to add a tag to an existing card, simply use the shortcut `Cmd/Ctrl` + `T`.
