# Heptabase: Getting Started

## Use Case and Workflow

Heptabase is a visual note-taking software specifically designed to help you learn and research complex topics, establishing a deep understanding of things you care about. If you want to solve one of the following problems, Heptabase is designed for you:

- [You want to improve your learning in topics you care about..md](./You%20want%20to%20improve%20your%20learning%20in%20topics%20you%20care%20about..md)

- [You want to make sense of the data, literature, and ideas related to your project to better achie.md](./You%20want%20to%20make%20sense%20of%20the%20data,%20literature,%20and%20ideas%20related%20to%20your%20project%20to%20better%20achie.md)

- [You want to plan and reflect on your life, sorting out your thoughts and emotions..md](./You%20want%20to%20plan%20and%20reflect%20on%20your%20life,%20sorting%20out%20your%20thoughts%20and%20emotions..md)

## Fundamental Elements

The design of Heptabase focuses on helping you better "understand the topics you care about," rather than simply "taking more notes." To familiarize yourself with Heptabase, we recommend first understanding the following three fundamental elements:

- [Card.md](./Card.md): Store knowledge and ideas.

- [Whiteboard.md](./Whiteboard.md): Understand the knowledge structure of certain topics.

- [Tag.md](./Tag.md): Assign properties to cards.

## User Interface Logic

In Heptabase, all your cards, whiteboards, and tags collectively form a "knowledge network," and Heptabase serves as the "browser" for this network. Therefore, the UI logic of Heptabase is similar to a browser, rather than a traditional folder.

- [Left Sidebar.md](./Left%20Sidebar.md): Tabs and bookmarks of the browser.

- [@Right Sidebar.md](./@Right%20Sidebar.md): Plugins of the browser.

- [Global Tool.md](./Global%20Tool.md): Search tool of the browser.
