# Highlight

There’s something almost ritualistically precise about the Hawaiian plate lunch. A scoop of pale macaroni salad, almost quietly radical in its steadfast, defiant plainness, nestles next to two scoops of white rice (it must be two, never three, never one). The rice serves as both a foundation and a mediator, bridging the creamy blandness of the pasta salad with the blunt-instrument intensity of the plate lunch’s third and central component, one kind or another of salty, savory meat.

# Note

The Hawaiian plate lunch is made in a very specific way. It always has a scoop of simple macaroni salad, which is plain but special in its own way. This salad is placed next to two scoops of white rice (it’s important to have two, not one or three). The rice is like a base that connects the creamy, mild pasta salad with the strong, tasty meat that is the main part of the meal.

夏威夷的盤餐幾乎有一種儀式般的精確感。一勺淡色的通心粉沙拉，幾乎在它堅定、挑釁的樸素中顯得安靜而激進，緊鄰著兩勺白米飯（必須是兩勺，絕對不能是三勺，也不能是一勺）。米飯既是基礎也是中介，將沙拉的奶油般的淡味與盤餐的第三個也是最核心的成分——某種鹹香的肉類——的鈍重強度連接起來。
