# Highlight

Ruth went on to lead the Yankees to seven World Series appearances and four championship titles, launching one of the greatest dynasties in the history of sports. The Red Sox, who brought home their fifth title, with Ruth, in 1918, didn’t win another championship [until 2004](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2004/11/08/the-curse-of-curses)—so strong was the Curse of the Bambino. Never mind the truth behind the Red Sox’s failures (poor decisions by management, and the profound racism of a subsequent owner, Tom Yawkey, who resisted integrating the team). Even the accuracy of the facts is mostly irrelevant. (Frazee was trying to fund the play “My Lady Friends,” on which “No, No, Nanette” was later based.) The trade changed Boston’s sense of its trajectory, even its sense of its identity. What mattered was the story.
