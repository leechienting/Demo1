Alongside poke bowls and the sport of surfing, the plate lunch has become one of the hallmarks of the fiftieth state. To understand the dish is to understand Hawaii’s particular genius for cultural synthesis. Its origins lie in the colonial plantations of the late nineteenth century, when agricultural workers—Indigenous Hawaiians, in addition to people brought in from Japan, China, the Philippines, and elsewhere—laboring on the islands’ vast fruit and sugar fields broke at midday for easy, cheap meals of rice packed up with whatever leftovers and accoutrements were handy. As Hawaii’s economy shifted throughout the years, so did lunch: ersatz food carts and wagons sprang up, serving meals similar to what workers would have brought from home: Japanese katsu, Chinese char siu, Filipino adobo; rice, of course, and macaroni salad, mild and mayonnaise-y, the indelible influence of the American mainland. The carts, in time, were supplemented with proper restaurants and, inevitably, chains both small and large. Today, you can find plate lunch served from trucks parked near construction sites and surf spots, from counters in strip malls, and from trendy, photogenic up-and-comers that gild the lily with carefully sourced ingredients and thoughtful little flourishes. The soul of the plate lunch remains unchanged: it is, fundamentally, a working person’s lunch, caloric and rib-sticking, elevated, through the decades, to something approximating an icon.

與波克碗和衝浪運動並肩而立，便當已成為第五十州的標誌之一。要理解這道菜，就必須理解夏威夷在文化綜合上的獨特天才。它的起源可以追溯到十九世紀末的殖民地種植園，當時農業工人——包括土著夏威夷人以及來自日本、中國、菲律賓等地的移民——在島上的廣大水果和糖田中工作，午餐時分會簡便、便宜地吃上一頓將米飯與隨手可得的剩菜和配料打包的餐食。隨著夏威夷經濟的變遷，午餐的形式也隨之改變：仿製的食品車和手推車出現，提供類似工人從家中帶來的餐點：日本豬排、中式叉燒、菲律賓醃肉；當然還有米飯和馬卡龍沙拉，口味溫和且含有美乃滋，這是美國本土的深遠影響。隨著時間的推移，這些食品車逐漸被正式的餐廳所補充，並不可避免地出現了大小不一的連鎖店。今天，你可以在靠近工地和衝浪點的卡車上找到便當，在商場的櫃檯，以及一些時尚、適合拍照的新興餐廳中，這些地方用精心挑選的食材和細心的小點綴來裝飾便當。便當的靈魂保持不變：它本質上是一頓工人的午餐，熱量充足且飽腹，經過幾十年的演變，已經提升至近乎一種象徵的地位。
