# Highlight

The problem with Harrison’s wager—conspiracy theories aside—is that he’s mistaking his story for *the* story. One of Harrison’s most important clients at Nike was Kobe Bryant, the prototypical maniac, who was consumed with becoming the best. Bryant famously hated when teammates would show up out of shape. He might have hated being teammates with Dončić. But Bryant was Harrison’s guy. Dončić was Dallas’s. For Harrison to be right, Mavericks fans would have to discover that the guy who they thought was *their guy* is actually a fraud. Who wants that? Trades happen. It was Harrison’s and Dumont’s defensiveness about it all, their refusal to see the tragedy in it, that made it a farce.
