Bentley was born in 1865 and raised on a farm in Jericho, Vermont. His father and brother spent their days tending to the property. Bentley was expected to pitch in, too, but he was more interested in studying the land than in working it. He became enthralled with a microscope given to him by his mother, a former schoolteacher, using it to study “drops of water, tiny fragments of stone, a feather dropped from a bird’s wing, a delicately veined petal from some flower,” he later wrote. “But always, from the very beginning it was the snowflakes that fascinated me most.” Under his microscope, Bentley discovered that each snowflake had its own careful and fleeting geometry. “Every crystal was a masterpiece of design and no one design was ever repeated,” he wrote. “When a snowflake melted, that design was forever lost.” He first tried his hand at drawing the snowflakes, but found that they were too elaborate for him to reproduce with adequate fidelity. Eventually, he got the idea to capture them photographically instead, but he ran into a significant hurdle: the camera that he needed would cost a princely sum. After two years of waiting, he persuaded his parents to use part of an inheritance they’d received after the death of Bentley’s grandmother to gift him a view camera for his seventeenth birthday.

Bentley was born in 1865 and raised on a farm in Jericho, Vermont. (本特利於1865年出生，並在佛蒙特州的傑里科一個農場長大。) His father and brother spent their days tending to the property. (他的父親和兄弟每天都在打理這片土地。) Bentley was expected to pitch in, too, but he was more interested in studying the land than in working it. (人們也期望本特利參與，但他對研究土地更感興趣，而非務農。) He became enthralled with a microscope given to him by his mother, a former schoolteacher, using it to study “drops of water, tiny fragments of stone, a feather dropped from a bird’s wing, a delicately veined petal from some flower,” he later wrote. (他對母親，一位前任教師，送給他的顯微鏡著迷，並用它來研究“水滴、微小的石頭碎片、一根從鳥翅膀上掉下來的羽毛、一片來自某種花的精緻花瓣”，他後來寫道。) “But always, from the very beginning it was the snowflakes that fascinated me most.” ( “但從一開始，最令我著迷的始終是雪花。”) Under his microscope, Bentley discovered that each snowflake had its own careful and fleeting geometry. (在他的顯微鏡下，本特利發現每片雪花都有自己精緻而短暫的幾何形狀。) “Every crystal was a masterpiece of design and no one design was ever repeated,” he wrote. ( “每一個晶體都是設計的傑作，沒有一個設計會重複。”) “When a snowflake melted, that design was forever lost.” ( “當雪花融化時，那個設計就永遠消失了。”) He first tried his hand at drawing the snowflakes, but found that they were too elaborate for him to reproduce with adequate fidelity. (他最初嘗試畫雪花，但發現它們太過精緻，無法忠實再現。) Eventually, he got the idea to capture them photographically instead, but he ran
