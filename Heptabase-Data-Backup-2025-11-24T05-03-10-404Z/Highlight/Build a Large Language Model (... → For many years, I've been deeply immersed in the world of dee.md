# Highlight

For many years, I've been deeply immersed in the world of deep learning, coding LLMs, and have found great joy in explaining complex concepts thoroughly. This book has been a long-standing idea in my mind, and I'm thrilled to finally have the opportunity to write it and share it with you. Those of you familiar with my work, especially from my blog, have likely seen glimpses of my approach to coding from scratch. This method has resonated well with many readers, and I hope it will be equally effective for you.
