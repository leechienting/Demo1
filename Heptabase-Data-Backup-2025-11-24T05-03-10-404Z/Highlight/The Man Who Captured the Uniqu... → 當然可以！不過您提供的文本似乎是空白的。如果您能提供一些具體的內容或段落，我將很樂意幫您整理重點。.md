Bentley was born in 1865 and raised on a farm in Jericho, Vermont. His father and brother spent their days tending to the property. Bentley was expected to pitch in, too, but he was more interested in studying the land than in working it. He became enthralled with a microscope given to him by his mother, a former schoolteacher, using it to study “drops of water, tiny fragments of stone, a feather dropped from a bird’s wing, a delicately veined petal from some flower,” he later wrote. “But always, from the very beginning it was the snowflakes that fascinated me most.” Under his microscope, Bentley discovered that each snowflake had its own careful and fleeting geometry. “Every crystal was a masterpiece of design and no one design was ever repeated,” he wrote. “When a snowflake melted, that design was forever lost.” He first tried his hand at drawing the snowflakes, but found that they were too elaborate for him to reproduce with adequate fidelity. Eventually, he got the idea to capture them photographically instead, but he ran into a significant hurdle: the camera that he needed would cost a princely sum. After two years of waiting, he persuaded his parents to use part of an inheritance they’d received after the death of Bentley’s grandmother to gift him a view camera for his seventeenth birthday.

本特利於1865年出生，並在佛蒙特州的傑里科的一個農場長大。他的父親和兄弟整天忙於照料農場，而本特利也被期望參與其中，但他對於研究土地更感興趣，而不是從事農活。他對母親送給他的顯微鏡產生了濃厚的興趣，開始用它來研究「水滴、微小的石塊、從鳥翅膀掉下來的羽毛、某朵花的精緻脈絡花瓣」，他後來寫道。「但從一開始，最令我著迷的總是雪花。」在他的顯微鏡下，本特利發現每片雪花都有其獨特而短暫的幾何形狀。「每個晶體都是設計的傑作，而沒有一個設計是重複的。」他寫道。「當一片雪花融化時，那個設計就永遠消失了。」他最初試著用繪畫來捕捉雪花，但發現這些雪花太過精緻，無法以足夠的真實性重現。最終，他想到用攝影來捕捉它們，但遇到了一個重大障礙：他需要的相機價格不菲。在等待了兩年後，他說服父母利用他祖母去世後獲得的部分遺產，為他準備了一台觀景相機，作為他十七歲生日的禮物。
