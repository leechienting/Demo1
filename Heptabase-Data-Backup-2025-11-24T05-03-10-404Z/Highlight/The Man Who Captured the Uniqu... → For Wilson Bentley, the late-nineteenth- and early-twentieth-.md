# Highlight

For Wilson Bentley, the late-nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century microphotographic innovator and bona-fide snowflake obsessive, contemplating the dazzling panoply of kaleidoscopic snow-crystal formations was a pastime that never lost its lustre. In fact, it is through Bentley’s encyclopedic collection of more than five thousand snowflake photographs, a portion of which are now housed in the Smithsonian Institution, that we got the notion of snowflakes’ singularity in the first place.

对于威尔逊·本特利，这位十九世纪末和二十世纪初的微摄影创新者和真正的雪花狂热者，思考那些绚丽多彩的雪晶形态的迷人景象是一种永不失去光彩的消遣。事实上，正是通过本特利的五千多张雪花照片的百科全书式收藏，其中一部分现在被收藏在史密森学会，我们才最初获得了雪花独特性的概念。
